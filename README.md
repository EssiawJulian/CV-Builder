## Overview
This project is a web application that enables users to generate professional tech resumes. By entering work experience, skills, education, and other details, users can quickly produce a polished, organized resume. Reducing the time to make and organize a resume by 70%. 

## Technologies Used
- **Vite** – Fast development build setup and bundling.
- **React** – Core framework for building UI components and handling application state.
- **HTML/CSS** – Structural and styling foundation of the webpage.
- **Node.js** – Primarily used for managing packages and running build scripts (such as `npm run build`). This setup does **not** inherently provide server-side rendering; it is used mainly for bundling and local development.

## Potential Improvements
- **Mobile Optimization** – Enhance responsiveness for smaller screens and mobile devices.
- **Additional Customization** – Offer more layout templates, style options, and custom sections.
- **Performance Enhancements** – Further optimize bundling configurations and caching to improve load times.
